This is a snake game designed for an arduino that is connected to 
an LED matrix of any particular size and takes input from a joystick 

Currently the pins and array names for input and output are not labelled correctly
and some functions are not complete

Testing is still required for:
	all parts of the code
	

THIS PROJECT IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS
